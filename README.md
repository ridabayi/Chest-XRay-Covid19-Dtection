# 4 Class Chest X-Ray Covid-19 Dtection:

In this projet we are using Deep Learning on Chest X-ray Images to Distinguish COVID-19 from Others Pneumonia Cases in addition to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, there are two other common
types: viral and bacterial pneumonia. They all present similar shapes and thus were difficult to distinguish. In this research, we proposed a deep, multi-layered classification of 
pneumonia based on a neural network using chest X-ray images. The experiment was conducted using the combination of two images from an open-source dataset collected by Cohen GP 
and Kagel. The data consists of 4 categories: normal pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia, viral pneumonia, and COVID19, for a total of 1,350 images. We considered two modified 
architectures: Xception and ResNet50. In addition, a comparison was made between the two models. The pre-trained Xception model in 100 epochs provided a classification accuracy 
of 94.2%.
